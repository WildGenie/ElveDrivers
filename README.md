ElveDrivers
===========

This repository contains C# .NET Device Drivers for the Elve Home Automation software package
from http://codecoretechnologies.com. Elve drivers must target the .NET 4.0 framework.

You will need the ILMERGE tool (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17630) installed 
to compile the drivers. Using IlMerge allows for easy deployment of a single DLL to the server per driver.
